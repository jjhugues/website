# Welcome to Read The Docs

[Read the Docs](http://readthedocs.org/) hosts documentation for the
open source community. We support [Sphinx](http://sphinx.pocoo.org/)
docs written with [reStructuredText](http://sphinx.pocoo.org/rest.html)
and [CommonMark](http://commonmark.org/). We pull your code from your
[Subversion](http://subversion.tigris.org/),
[Bazaar](http://bazaar.canonical.com/), [Git](http://git-scm.com/), and
[Mercurial](http://mercurial.selenic.com/) repositories. Then we build
documentation and host it for you. Think of it as *Continuous
Documentation*.

The code is open source, and [available on
github](http://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org).

The main documentation for the site is organized into a couple sections:

  - user-docs
  - feature-docs
  - about-docs

Information about development is also available:

  - dev-docs
  - design-docs
  - ops-docs
